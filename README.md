# Power BI Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases a selection of **professional Power BI dashboards** I designed and developed at Pure Analytica as part of the **POS Insights analytics suite**.  
Dashboards are based on fully anonymous, aggregated retail data and demonstrate:

- Advanced data modeling  
- DAX measure design  
- Visual storytelling  
- KPI engineering  
- Retail analytics domain knowledge  
- Performance optimization  
- Interactive drill-downs  
- UX-focused layout design  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Several dashboards I developed that integrate **machine learning models** (forecasting, anomaly detection, predictive sales) cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality.  
> What is included here represents only a portion of my BI work.
> To respect confidentiality, all dashboards are based on a fully synthetic database that I engineered myself.  
I designed the relational schema, created fact/dimension tables, and generated realistic operational data following 
true inventory and purchase-order lifecycles (stock aging, stockouts, branch distribution, lead time variance, vendor 
performance patterns, etc.).
> This demonstrates my ability to build complete analytics systems end-to-end — from data modeling and simulation, to 
DAX, visualization, and KPI engineering.
